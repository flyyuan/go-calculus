# Go-Calculus

Go-Calculus is a comprehensive library implemented in Go, providing functionalities for various calculus computations. This library aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to perform calculus operations, including limit calculations, differentiation, integration, and more. It also includes specific applications of calculus such as discontinuity resolution and higher-order differentiation.

## Features

- Limit calculations: Compute the limit of a function as it approaches a certain value.
- Differentiation: Compute the derivative of a function, including higher-order derivatives.
- Integration: Compute the definite and indefinite integrals of a function.
- Discontinuity detection: Identify the type of discontinuity at a certain point in a function and provide methods for resolution.
- Real-world applications: Implementations of calculus concepts in real-world problem-solving.
